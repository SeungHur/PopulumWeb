******README******
This project represents the initial push of the populum website. keep in mind, this is months away from the final version and EVERYTHING is subject to change.
As of now, only the home-page is viewable and partially complete. I won't have time to work on the site for some time due to school, but finishing the bio and media pages will be my next priority.

all server stuffs will be done at my house and I will register a hostname in 2 weeks.
